# Project Pitch
The name of our product is Named Entity Recognition System and it is helpful for any company invested in the business of personal data. It is an application to help users identify a specific person in a document out of a long list of potential matches. Without a capability of this nature, this task could be extremely difficult if working with a large dataset of individuals. 

In a global economy where data is increasingly valuable, we want to help you manage personally identifiable information. Names are a special case of personal data. In documents translated from one language to another, names are often transliterated. In this process, data may be lost, leaving you with inconsistent spellings, partial names, and missing cultural or contextual knowledge. Human error also creates data loss. Spell checking software can exacerbate this issue with unfamiliar names. Individuals may also have their identity purposefully obscured. We want to help you accurately identify individuals every time, for increased proficiency. 

Our product implements a patented method of database searching (from NSA) that is tailored to efficiently search multiple input terms, where each term has multiple alternative spellings. This allows us to account for variant spellings, partial names, and other missing or erroneous information. In addition, our database stores other identifying information along with each name, to use for finding expressions that refer to that individual in a document.
